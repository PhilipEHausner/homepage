abstract: Streamlines are a common visualization concept to describe the structure of vector fields, especially in computational fluid dynamics. With the introduction of uncertainty to vector fields, new techniques are required for streamline-based visualization. With the help of two-dimensional distribution fields, we track the particle density distributions on a cell-based grid over time, starting with a fixed particle density in a single cell. Additionally, we investigate a new aspect of uncertainty, so called domain-uncertainty. While uncertain vector fields store a probability distribution of vectors at every position, domain-uncertain data defines a unique certain vector at every position, however, the position itself is uncertain. In this thesis, domain-uncertain data is defined and problems that arise when dealing with such data are discussed. Furthermore, we analyse the behaviour of uncertain streamlines and of streamlines that are defined on an uncertain domain. Subsequently, we make use of distribution grids to analyse the structure of streamlines in regard to different, two-dimensional uncertain vector fields and apply our method to a test data set. Eventually, we employ space-time representation to provide an at-a-glance visualization of 2D streamlines in uncertain vector fields.
