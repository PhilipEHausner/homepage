abstract: Getting an overview of a complex phenomenon that is described in numerous documents poses a major challenge in many application domains, among which the legal domain is of particular societal interest. In this paper, we outline a framework that is based on constructing term co-occurrence networks from documents and that allows users to explore a collection of court documents in a time-centric fashion, thus providing insights into a caseâ€™s chronology and entities involved.
